      <h2>Team History</h2>
      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPlaying in the storied Cotton Bowl, the 1960 Cowboys had to settle for one tie in 12 games and Dallas didn't break even until its sixth season in 1965. 
        But in 1966, the Cowboys began an NFL-record streak of 20 consecutive winning seasons. 
        That streak included 18 years in the playoffs, 13 divisional championships, five trips to the Super Bowl and victories in Super Bowls VI and XII.
        During their big years of the 1970s, the Cowboys were led by such future Pro Football Hall of Fame members as quarterback Roger Staubach, tackle Rayfield Wright, defensive tackles Bob Lilly and Randy White, defensive back Mel Renfro and running back Tony Dorsett.
        The Cowboys of the 1970s and early 1980s were known as <b>"America's Team"</b>. An outfit that was just a step ahead of almost every other club.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspH. R. "Bum" Bright, who had purchased the Cowboys from Murchison in 1984, sold the team to Jerry Jones in 1989. Jones named former University of Miami coach Jimmy Johnson to replace Landry, who finished his career with 270 victories, third most by any coach in history.
        Johnson's first team won only once in 16 games but some daring trades and shrewd selections in the annual NFL draft - that included Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman - quickly returned the Cowboys to championship status in Super Bowl XXVII, the fourth season of the Jerry Jones regime. 
        They followed with a second straight world title in Super Bowl XXVIII. 
        In March 1994, college coach Barry Switzer replaced Johnson as the Cowboys third head coach. 
        The winning continued under Switzer, as the "Team of the Nineties" won its third Super Bowl in four years with a 27-17 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XXX.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfter the Super Bowl success of the 1990's, the Cowboys subsequently went through a Super Bowl slump amassing losing seasons, and new coaching staffs.
         The lone bright spot was undrafted free agent quarterback Tony Romo, who joined the team in 2003. But it wasn't until 2006 that Romo became a starter for the injured Drew Bledsoe. 
         He never looked back. By the end of his career, Tony Romo had the record for most passing touchdowns, most passing yards, and most 4th quarter comebacks in team history.
         Although, he is usually not defined by his stats, but by his 2-4 playoff record, never advancing past the divisional round.         
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDak Prescott, the current face of the franchise, started the 2016 season after quarterback Tony Romo was injured in pre-season. 
        That year Dak took the Cowboys to a 13-3 season until losing in the first round of the playoffs. 
        He also earned Offensive Rookie of the Year and Pro-bowl selections. 
        In Dak's 5 full seasons as Cowboys quarterback he has a 1-2 playoffs record, never passing the divisional round.
        He was recently awarded a 4-year $160 million contract in 2021. 
        With a good team around him, Dak is looking to win a Super Bowl soon.

        <h2>AT&T Stadium</h2>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Cowboys played at Texas Stadium for over 30 years until their current stadium, AT&T stadium, officially opened in 2009.
          Although, building a $1.15 billion stadium in Arlington, Texas, just outside Dallas county, would not be easy. 
          To secure enough money, Arlington voters approved a $325 million bond, and then the NFL contributed another $150 million, while the Cowboys paid the remaining amount.
          It has the capacity to seat nearly 100,000 fans and boasts a 160 feet long by 71 feet high HD videoboard.

        <h2>Rhythm and Blue</h2>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA co-ed dance team that was created in 2009. 
          This high energy group adds a certain flare to Cowboys game-days.
          The only concept of its kind, they lead the celebrations for every single score during the game.
          They have even been nationally recognized by Dance Magazine and various industry insiders that say "DCRB is changing the face of sports entertainment!"
          They even make appearances at events domestically and internationally!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="bottomContent">
        <h2>Rookie Squad</h2>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Rhythm and Blue dance concept was such a success that in 2017 the Dallas Cowboys Rookie Squad was created.
          They are a group of talented young dancers aged 7-16. 
          This program gives those kids an opporotunity to gain valuable experience to grow into professional performers. 
          Falling under a smaller umbrela of the Rhythm and Blue. 
          Together, the two groups share the same choreographer and perform side by side during games.
